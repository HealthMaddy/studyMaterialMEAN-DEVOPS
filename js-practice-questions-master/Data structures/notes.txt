    -connected via nodes with a next pointer
    -random access is not allowed
 Arrays:
    -indexed in order
    -insertion and deletion can be expensive
    -can quickly be accessed at a specific index

What is a tree?
A data structure that consists of nodes in a parent/child relationship

1.Lists- are linear     2.Trees- are non-linear

In tree every node points only to its children

2.Child- A node directly connected to another node when moving away from the root.
3.Parent- The converse notion of a child
4.Siblings- A group of nodes with the same parent
5.Leaf- A node with no children
6.Edge- The connection between one node and another
