1.Radix sort is a special sorting algorithm that works on lists and numbers
2.it never makes comparisons between elements
3.it exploits the fact that information about the size of a number is encoded in the number of digits
4.more digits means a bigger number
5.mostly it works with base 10 numbers

Big O
time complexity

best case:O(nk)  Average Case:O(nk) Worst Case:O(nk)

space complexity :O(n+k)

        :n -length of array
        :k -number of digits(average)
