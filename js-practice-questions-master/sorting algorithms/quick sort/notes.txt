1.Like merge sort ,exploits the fact that arrays of 0 and 1 element are always sorted
2.works by selecting one element(called the "pivot") and finding the index where the pivot
should end up in the sorted array
3.Once the pivot is positioned appropriately, quick sort can be on either side of pivot

PIOVT HELPER

1.In order to imlement merge sort,it's useful to first implement a function
 responsile arrranging elements in an array on eiter side of a pivot
 2.give an array, this helper function should designate an element as the pivot
 3.it should rearrange then elements in the array, and all values greater than the pivot
 are moved to the right of the pivot
 4.the order of elements on either side of the pivot doesn't matter!
 5.the helper should do this in place,that is ,it should not create a new array
 6.when complete, the helper should return the index of the pivot


 PICKING A PIVOT
 1.the runtime of quick sort depends in part on how one selects the pivot
 2.ideally, the pivot should be chosen set you're sorting
 3.for simplicity, we'll always choose the pivot to be the first element

time complexity

best case:O(n log n)  Average Case:O(n log n) Worst Case:O(n^2)

space complexity :O(log n)
