1.It's a combination of two things -merging and sorting!
2.Exploits the fact that arrays of 0 or 1 element are always sorted
3.works by decomposing an array of 0 or 1 elements,then building up a newly sorted array

Big O
time complexity

best case:O(n log n)  Average Case:O(n log n) Worst Case:O(n log n)
[
    note: O(log n) came from decomposing the larger array in smaller ones,and the O(n)
came from the comparing and composing the smaller pieces of array
]

space complexity :O(n)
